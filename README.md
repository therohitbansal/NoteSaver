# NoteSaver
- The scope of this application was to be familiar with how to use MERN stack and CRUD while building a full stack web application.

## Functionality of The App
- This app is similar to [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com). 
- Users can add notes as many as they wanted.
- They can delete and edit the notes that are taken.
- Additionally editing time will be recorded.

## What I Have Used
- For the backend server environment, I used [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) framework to design application layer.
- For the persistence of data, I used [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) as my database to store user's notes.
  - A note schema holds title and content fields.
- For the frontend i used [React.js](https://en.reactjs.org) library to design the client side of the application.
- React hooks especially [useState](https://en.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate), [useEffect](https://en.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect) and [useRef](https://en.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref) are used to increase effectiveness of the application through maintaining(useState), refreshing(useEffect) and reassigning(useRef) amongst component states.
- For deploying the app to [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com), [I followed this article.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/deploying-a-mern-application-using-mongodb-atlas-to-heroku).
